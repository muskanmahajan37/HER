## Problem Statement

### Build a recommendation engine

- Given Preciselyâ€™s dataset of opportunities, cluster them based on relevant semantic meanings [ 54 points ]
Example: If there is an opportunity for computer science students and another opportunity related to Machine Learning, they should be clustered closer together, when compared with a Social Sciences opportunity

-  Given a dataset of user preferences, recommend opportunities from the opportunity dataset [ 54 points ]
